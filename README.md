nano Query plugin
=================

The **Query** plugin for the [nano JavaScript framework](http://nanojs.org) uses the [Sizzle](http://www.sizzlejs.com) CSS selector engine, the same used in the core of the [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) library.

Installation
------------

To add the **Query** plugin include it in the `<head>` of the document, after the core framework:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Site</title>
    <script src="path/to/nano.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/nano.query.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
		
    <!-- your content here -->
		
  </body>
</html>
```
